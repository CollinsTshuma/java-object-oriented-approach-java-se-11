# java-object-oriented-approach-java-se-11

Hi everyone, and welcome to my project, Java Object‑Oriented Approach. Object‑oriented programming is the most natural and pragmatic way of modeling the real world. This project will teach you the fundamental concepts of OOP that you can leverage to write domain‑oriented and flexible code in Java. Some of the major topics that we'll cover include defining and working with objects, classes, and packages; modeling state and behavior with instance and static fields and methods; understanding encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism; and exploring powerful Java constructs, such as enum types and nested classes. By the end of this project, we'll have all the OOP skills and knowledge needed to create more robust software applications. Before beginning the course, you should be familiar with the Java programming language. And if you already have an understanding of OOP, that will definitely help, although it is not mandatory.
